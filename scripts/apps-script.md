# Apps Script Setup Guide

The Apps Script proxy enables three optional features:

- **CLA via Google Sheets** — fetch your CLA exports directly from Google Sheets by URL, instead of pasting CSV manually
- **Item icon lookups** — automatically fetch Wowhead icons for items not already in the item database
- **Warcraftlog Player Data** — automatically fetches warcrat logs data for every player and displays it alongside other information on most tables.

If you set `"enable_apps_script": false` and `"enable_wcl": false` in `config.json`, all features are disabled and you can skip this guide entirely. CLA data can still be imported by pasting raw CSV directly in the dashboard, unknown items will display without wowhead enrichment (tooltips/icons), and the warcraft logs column will be hidden.

## Create the Apps Script Project

1. Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com) and click **New project**
2. Add four files to the project (use the **+** button next to Files):

### `main.gs` — router
```javascript
function doGet(e) {
  const action = e.parameter.action;
  if (action === 'wclAuth' || action === 'wclQuery') return handleWcl(e);
  if (e.parameter.itemId) return handleIconLookup(e);
  return handleProxy(e);
}
```

### `proxy.gs` — sheet fetches + item lookups
Paste the contents of `scripts/proxy.gs` from the repo.

### `wcl-proxy.gs` — WarcraftLogs OAuth + GraphQL
Paste the contents of `scripts/wcl-proxy.gs` from the repo.
Only needed if you are also enabling WarcraftLogs integration.

### `icon-lookup.gs` — Wowhead icon lookup
Paste the contents of `scripts/icon-lookup.gs` from the repo.

3. Click **Deploy → New deployment**
4. Type: **Web app** · Execute as: **Me** · Who has access: **Anyone**
5. Click **Deploy** and copy the URL

Set this URL as `apps_script` in `config.json` and set `enable_apps_script: true`.

## Using CLA with Apps Script Enabled

When `enable_apps_script` is `true`, the CLA tab shows URL and GID fields instead of paste fields.

**Finding GIDs:** Open the CLA Google Sheet, click the tab you want, and look at the URL: `...#gid=123456789` — the number after `gid=` is what you need.

For each raid CLA:
1. Navigate to the **CLA** tab → click **+ Add**
2. Fill in:
   - **Label** — short name shown in attendance table (e.g. `Mar 25`)
   - **Google Sheet URL** — the full URL of the CLA export sheet
   - **Issues GID** — gid of the Gear Issues tab
   - **Gear GID** — gid of the Gear Listing tab *(optional)*
   - **Consumes GID** — gid of the Buff Consumables tab
3. Click **+ Add** — data is fetched and parsed immediately

Make sure each CLA Google Sheet is set to **"Anyone with the link can view"**.

### Set Up WarcraftLogs Integration (Optional)

Skip this section and set `"enable_wcl": false` in `config.json` if you don't want WCL performance data in the dashboard.

### Create a WarcraftLogs API Client

1. Go to [www.warcraftlogs.com/api/clients](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/api/clients)
2. Click **Create Client**
3. Fill in:
   - **Name**: anything (e.g. "My LC Dashboard")
   - **Redirect URL**: your GitHub Pages URL exactly, e.g. `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo/`  
     *(Must match exactly — no trailing slash issues)*
4. Check the Public Client box
5. Click **Create** and copy the **Client ID**

### Configure Your Apps Script for WCL

If you deployed your own Apps Script project already, no additional steps are needed — the WCL handler is already included. Just set `enable_wcl: true` and add your `wcl_client_id` and `wcl_realm` to `config.json`.

### Add WCL config to `config.json`

```json
{
  ...
  "enable_wcl": true,
  "wcl_client_id": "paste-your-client-id-here",
  "wcl_realm": "your-realm-name",
  "wcl_zone_id": 1048,
  "wcl_game_slug": "tbc-classic"
}
```

The realm name is the lowercase hyphenated version of your realm name as it appears in WarcraftLogs URLs, e.g. `area-52`, `nightslayer`, `dreamscythe`.

`wcl_zone_id` controls which raid zone WCL rankings are pulled from. `1048` is Gruul's Lair / Magtheridon for TBC Classic Anniversary — update this as your guild progresses to SSC/TK (1004) or Hyjal/BT (1005). `wcl_game_slug` must match the game version on WarcraftLogs: `tbc-classic` for TBC Classic Anniversary, `classic` for Season of Discovery.

### Connect in the Dashboard

1. Open the dashboard — a **⚡ Connect WarcraftLogs** button appears at the bottom right
2. Click it — you'll be redirected to WarcraftLogs to authorise
3. After authorising, you'll be redirected back and the button changes to **⚡ Connected to WarcraftLogs**
4. WCL performance data will now appear in the WCL column on all player tables

## Troubleshooting

**CLA sheets fail to load**
- Verify the sheet is set to "Anyone with the link can view"
- Check the GIDs are correct by inspecting the tab URLs
- Verify the `apps_script` URL in `config.json` is correct and deployed with "Anyone" access
- Check the Apps Script **Executions** tab for errors

**Icons not appearing**
- Icons only load for items not already in `gear-item-ids.json`
- If `enable_apps_script` is false, icons will not load for unknown items

**WCL shows spinners but no data**
- Verify the redirect URL in your WCL client matches your GitHub Pages URL exactly
- Check that `wcl_realm` matches the realm slug on WarcraftLogs (check character URLs)
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting via the button at the bottom of the sidebar
